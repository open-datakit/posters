This poster introduces opendata.fit, a web-based data analysis and
publication platform. opendata.fit is focused on enabling reproducibility
and open science by providing a user-friendly data analysis platform for
scientists that automatically captures data provenance and analysis history
for publication. opendata.fit builds on the work of Bindfit, a web-based
binding constant fitting tool developed by the Thordarson group at UNSW.

opendata.fit aims to provide users with a discipline-agnostic platform to
manage scientific analysis workflows and datasets from development to
publication. It provides tooling to upload experiment data, run analysis
algorithms in the cloud, visualise results, and publish complete workflows
as citable entities. Users will be able to choose from a library of
existing workflows or write their own. It currently supports execution of
Python-based analysis algorithms with plans to extend support to other
common scientific computing languages.

opendata.fit is released as a closed beta with testing accounts available
on request. There are two workflows currently available: the Bindfit
binding constant fitting tool and a small angle scattering data analysis
tool based on the SasView Python package.
